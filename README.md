BidWars

BidWars is a real-time multiplayer auction game where players compete to win items, manage limited balances, and outbid each other before each auction ends.

Built as a full-stack project focused on real-time systems, state synchronization, authentication, and external API integration.

Deployment note: BidWars is not currently live because some of its external services, including text-to-speech, incur ongoing usage costs. The repository remains available for code review.

Tech Stack

* Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
* Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
* Data: MongoDB Atlas, Redis / Upstash
* AI: Grok API, Lemonfox TTS
* Deployment: Vercel, Render

Key Features

* Real-time multiplayer auction rooms
* Live bidding and synchronized game state with Socket.IO
* Player balances and post-game item distribution
* JWT authentication using HTTP-only cookies
* Room-level authorization
* Redis-backed active game state
* MongoDB persistent storage
* AI-generated auctioneer commentary with text-to-speech

Game State   Persistent Data

The backend acts as the authoritative source of game state. When a player submits a bid, the server validates it, updates the auction state, and broadcasts the result to every connected player in the room.

Redis handles frequently changing multiplayer state, while MongoDB stores longer-lived application data.

Engineering Highlights

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

* Synchronizing state across multiple clients in real time
* Designing server-authoritative multiplayer logic
* Handling concurrent bidding and validation
* Building authentication and authorization middleware
* Separating temporary and persistent application state
* Integrating third-party AI and text-to-speech APIs
* Deploying a multi-service full-stack application

Running Locally

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd BidWars
```
Install dependencies in the frontend and backend directories:
```bash
npm install
```
Configure the required environment variables, then run both development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```
